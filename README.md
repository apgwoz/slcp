#slcp

slcp is a simple shell prompt written in C. If you are annoyed by different Prompt configurations in various shells or would like to minimize the amount of processes required to get all information you want to have in your prompt, feel free to fork and modify slcp to your needs.


#Dependencies

Currently slcp just requires libgit2. If you do not need git repository highlighting or any other git features in your prompt, it can easily be removed from the source.


#Contribution

If you have an awesome idea, that should be implemented, you can do it yourself and open a pull request or send a message and tell me, why your idea is useful und should be included in slcp.
